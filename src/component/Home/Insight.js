          <h5>
            Design Insights are some of the most powerful things in the galaxy.
            Theyâ€™re the flashes of deep understanding that are only unearthed
            through careful observation, accurate data, and years of experience.
            And they can make the difference between a billion dollar product
            and one that fails miserably.
